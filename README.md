# DeepCommedy

In this project we developed two models able to generate texts similar to Danteâ€™s Divine Comedy, with particular attention given to making sure that verses are correctly syllabified.  
  
Two different architectures have been developed: the first is composed of a single Generator model trained on pre-syllabified data to directly generate syllabified verses. The second one is composed of a Generator trained with non syllabified data which generates verses and a Syllabifier trained with syllabified data to demonstrate that the generated verses are correct.
